# VEX-EXP-AGV-DRIVE-CODE
CODE IS MADE FOR VEX EXP. AGV made using VEX EXP parts, plus 2 VEX cortex line trackers. Specs and operations of the AGV are based off the PLTW project statement for a AGV
In the Computer Intregrated Manufacturing Class (CIM). The linetracker values many need to vary depending on the color values your sensor recieves and the color of the line
and floor you are following on. This AGV specifically was run on a marble floor and followed black electrical tape. To see the AGV in action and some more specfics about the
